**This theme is currently in development, so don't expect much out of it.**

## Overview

This is a color theme for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) based on work and study I've done involving human vision.

The name is given to the slightly off hue compared to "standard" colors. The pallet itself is largely based around photometric uniformity, and utilizes the bias in human perception to "weight" things.

Because, within the palette, saturation and value are often not adjusted, the actual color only varies in hue. Human perception however is biased in acuity towards certain hues. The exact color chosen for any specific token is therefore based mostly around these human perceptual biases, although at rare times will resort to adjustments in saturation and value.

## Assumptions

The palette used by this color theme makes some assumptions:
* The user has no colorblindness
* The user does not need high contrast
* The user does not need low contrast
* The user is working on at least a 6-bit display
* The user's environment is generally white-light illuminated

Every palette makes assumptions in order to work. After the "normal" palette is finished, I will consider doing palettes with the same spirit for deuteranomaly, deuteranopia, protanomaly, protanoptia, tritanomaly, and tritanopia. Achromatopsia is impossible to create a palette for, and so won't ever have considerations for under this project.

# Help Me Out

Good quality extensions take a lot of time. Considerably more than just "meh, close enough" level work. If you'd like to help out but don't know how to contribute to the code, consider donating to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Entomy). Leave a message with the donation about it being for this extension, and I'll weight my work towards this.
