**This theme is currently in development, so don't expect much out of it.**

## Overview

This is a color theme for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) based on work and study I've done involving human vision.

The name is given to the slightly off hue compared to "standard" colors. The pallet itself is largely based around perceptual uniformity, although some considerations are made for _importance_ of information.
